      <h2 class="subheading">The Internet</h2>
        <p class="text">The internet is a network of computers communicating
         with each other through the use of HTTP requests. Client computers
         request <em>HTML</em> documents from web servers &lpar;any computer
         hosting a file can be a server though "servers" usually refer to
         dedicated platforms&rpar; through the internet. The server sends the
         HTML file to the client computer where a browser interprets and
         displays the file. </p>

         of tubes.</p>

      <h2 class="subheading">Code</h2>
        <p class="text">Code is instructions written in a language that
         computers can understand. Programmers interpret what the humans want
         computers to do so that computers can then execute the instructions.

      <h2 class="subheading">"Stupid" Computers</h2>
        <p class="text">Computers interpret code literally and will do
          exactly what they are told. They cannot deduce what you meant for
          them to do, so errant instructions &lpar;"bugs" in the code&rpar; 
          wreak havoc on websites and programs.</p>

  <article class="category">
    <h1 class="heading">HTML</h1>
      <p class="text">Websites are text documents written in HTML. "HTML" is
       short for "HyperText Markup Language." A "language" consists of syntax
       + rules. The information on a website is its "content" while the
       formatting is done with "markup" using <em>elements</em> and <em>tags
       </em>. HTML tells the browser what kind of content is on the page:
       text, image, etc. Webpages with the same HTML can look different
       because of the style applied to them.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Document Object Model</h2>
        <p class="text">DOM is the tree-like structure of HTML which sees
         elements as boxes within boxes within boxes. This compartmentalizing
         of the elements of a website enables programs to access and change
         parts of the website without altering the other parts. Elements and
         tags are the basic components of the tree structure.</p>

        <p class="text">Elements are related to each other vertically as
          "parents" and "children" or laterally as "siblings." Children are
          nested within their parents, and siblings have the same parent
          element. Most child elements are the parents of other elements and
          vice versa. This gives the DOM its "tree-like" structure because
          the child elements branch off from their parents, then their child
          elements branch off from them, and so on.</p>

        <p class="text">Here is a diagram of the DOM of <a href=
          "http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/explore.html">
          this sample page:</a></p>

        <img class="image" src=
        "http://s30.postimg.org/m3egmiga9/DOM_diagram.png" alt="Diagram of a
        Sample DOM" title="Diagram of a Sample DOM">

        <p class="text">This shows that the "head" and "body" elements are
          children of the "html" element and branch off from it. "Head" and
          "body" are siblings. The "body" element has two children of its
          own: "h1" and "div". Those both branch off of their parent, so
          they are siblings, and both have children of their own. And so on.
        </p>

        <p class="text">Programmers can move vertically or laterally along
          the DOM. Their code can follow the parent-child relationships to
          access different elements. This is the basis of inheritance: The
          children of a parent element will have that elements' properties
          unless their code supersedes it. For example: The "font" property
          on the "body" element of this webpage is "Times New Roman". That
          means that the font property of all the children elements is also
          Times New Roman without having to set that property for each
          element. However, the blue background of the body element is
          superseded by code in the child elements that says to have a white
          background.</p>

        <p class="text">Division: &lt;div class="example"&gt;content&lt;/div
          &gt; - Applies the "example" class to everything within this
          document division.<br>
          Span: &lt;span class="example"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; - Applies
          the "example" class to everything within this line section.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Semantic Structure</h2>
        <p class="text">HTML5 introduced semantic elements that describe the
          content that they contain. They compartmentalize things like "div"
          or "span" but mean something as well. <a href=
          "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">Look
          here for more information.</a> The following are the semantic
          elements listed on that page:

      <h2 class="subheading">Elements and Tags</h2>
        <p class="text">An <b>element</b> includes the opening and closing
          tags and the content between them. Elements can also have <em>
          attributes</em>.</p>

        <p class="text">A <b>tag</b> is a command for the web browser that is
          set within angle brackets. Tags usually come in opening and closing
          pairs, but <em>void tags</em> do not have a closing tag. Tags can
          format text, create links, display images, and more. They can also
          have attributes with values.</p>

          Bold: &lt;b&gt;<b>bold</b>&lt;/b&gt; <br>
          Emphasis: &lt;em&gt;<em>emphasis</em>&lt;/em&gt;<br>
          Line Break &lpar;inline&rpar;: &lt;br&gt; - Inline elements violate
          other elements' personal space. <br>
          Paragraph &lpar;block&rpar;: &lt;p&gt;paragraph&lt;/p&gt; - Block
          elements have an "invisible" box around them. Like mimes. <br>
          Heading, where # is 1-6: &lt;h#&gt;heading&lt;/h#&gt;<br>
          Comment: &lt;!--Comments are not displayed by the browser.--&gt;
          <br>

      <p class="text"><b>Attributes</b> are special tags that set the
        properties of an HTML element.</p>

        Anchor &lpar;makes links&rpar;: &lt;a href="http://www.uaf.edu"&gt;<a

    <h1 class="heading">CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
      <p class="text">CSS is another language with syntax and rules. It gives
        HTML elements their style. Browsers have built-in style sheets, but
        that is superceded by the style sheet belonging to the website.</p>

    <section class="text">
      <h2 class="subheading">Vocabulary</h2>
          Cascading: Go down the rules until finding the most specific rule
          which overrides the other rules.<br>
          Style:
        <ol>
          <li>HTML Element: &lt;style&gt;div {color:blue;} &lt;/style&gt;
          </li>
          <li>HTML Attribute:  &lt;div style="color:blue;"&gt;<span style=
            "color:blue;">blue text</span>&lt;div&gt;</li>
          <li>Noun: The way a webpage looks.</li>
          <li>Verb: To make the webpage look a certain way.</li>
        </ol>
        Rule: A line of CSS code that describes the value that an attribute
        should take.<br>
        Property: The thing that is being changed.<br>
        Value: What the thing that is being changed is changed to.<br>
        Selector: The name of the HTML class or attribute that the properties
        belong to.<br>
        Class: A group of elements that are styled together. Cannot contain
        punctuation.<br>
        ID: The unique identifier of an HTML element.<br>

      Best Practice: Create a separate CSS file and add &lt;link

    <section class="text">
      <h2 class="subheading">Structure</h2>
        <p class="text">Container elements are the boxes that content lives
          in. Every HTML element has four elements: content, padding,
          border, andmargin.<br>
          The size of an element/box is: Content + Padding + Border<br>
          It can be difficult to get the size of a box just right, so try two
          things:<p>
        <ol>
          <li>Set sizes in terms of percentages instead of pixels</li>
          <li>Se the box-sizing attribute to border-box</li>
        </ol>

          Content: The image or text that appears on the site<br>
          Division: &lt;div&gt;Defines a block in a document&lt;/div&gt;<br>
          Span: &lt;span&gt;Defines an in-line section of a document&lt;/span
          &gt;
          <br>
          Padding: Clears an area around the content and has the background
          color
          <br>
          Border: Goes around the padding and has the color of the box itself
          <br>
          Margin: Creates a transparent space between boxes by clearing the
          area around the border<br>

        <p class="text">Divisions default to the entire width of a page, but
          "display:flex;" will let divisions appear next to each other.<br>

      <p>Natural languages are ambiguous: Different people can interpret the
        same sentence to mean different things, but we want computers to
        interpret things the same way every time.</p>
      <p>Natural languages are verbose: It takes too many words to detail every
        step of even a simple action.</p>
      <p>Example: print 2 + 2 +<br>
        We can figure out what this means, but Python produces a syntax error.

      <h2 class="subheading">Backus-Naur Form</h2>
      <p>The full Backus-Naur Form is pretty complicated, as this
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">
      Wikpedia article</a> shows, but the gist is that it use symbols to show
      how computer programming languages work. The gist of it is that 
      non-terminals &lpar;variables&rpar; are on the left side with an arrow 
      pointing towards their replacements which can be other variables, the 
      same variable, or terminals which have no replacements and never appear 
      on the left side of the form.</p>

      <p>A derivation is when you keep working down the expression until all of 
      the non-terminals are replaced by terminals. We can explain Python that 
      way.</p>

      <p>Note: Python ignores the decimal &lpar;remainder&rpar; when you divide
        an integer by another integer. You need to give one of the variables a

      <h2 class="subheading">Variables</h2>
      <p>Variables make it easy to refer to expressions because rather than
        type the whole expression out again you can refer to its variable. It
        simultaneously labels the expression and lets you refer back to it
        to reduce the amount of repeat code.</p>

      <p>A 'magic number' is a number without a variable. Those are bad.</p>

      <p>You assign a value to a variable when you state what expression or 
        number it represents. You do that using &equals; which does not mean 
        "equals" like in math but is an arrow indicating that whatever is to 
        the right of the &equals; is the value of the variable on the left.</p>

      Arithmetic: 2 &plus; 3 &equals; 5<br>
      Python: my_variable &equals; 5<br>

      <p>The above is an example of an Assignment Statement: name &equals;
        expression</p>

      <p>Python will keep calculating and updating the value of a variable as
        it moves down the code.</p>

      <section class="code">
        <table>
        <tr>
        <td>days</td> <td>&equals;</td> <td>7 &midast; 7</td> 
          <td>&num; Result: 49</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>days</td> <td>&equals;</td> <td>48</td> 
          <td>&num; Changes the value to 48</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>days</td> <td>&equals;</td> <td>days &minus; 1</td> 
          <td>&num; Result: 48 - 1 = 47. Variable has a new value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>days</td> <td>&equals;</td> <td>days &minus; 1</td>
          <td>&num; Result: 47 - 1 = 46</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

      <h2 class="subheading">Strings</h2>
      <p>Python isn't just numbers. You can have sequences of characters called
      strings. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes, &apos; or 
      &quote;, to delineate them from variables. It doesn't matter which you
      use so long as the string begins and ends with the same one.</p>

      <section class="code">
        print 'Hello' # Result: Hello<br>
        print "Hello" # Result: Hello<br>
      </section>

      <p>You can add strings together which is called "concatenation", but you
      cannot concatenate strings and integers. You need to include the spaces
      in the strings as Python will not add them. You can multiply strings.</p>

      <section class="code">
        name = "Corey"<br>
        print "Hello" &plus; name &num; Result: HelloCorey<br>
        print "Hello " + name + 10 * "!" &num; Result: Hello Corey!!!!!!!!!!
        <br>
      </section>

      <p>Note that strings are not integers. You cannot do math with strings.
        Instead of being summed, numbers in strings are printed side by side.
      </p>

      <section class="code">
      print 2 + 2 # Result: 4<br>
      print "2" + "2" # Result: 22<br>
      </section>

      <p>You can select the characters of a string, called 'indexing', by 
      putting an integer or expression in square brackets. The first character 
      in a string is 0 and count right. Negative numbers start at the end of 
      the string with -1 and count left.<p>

      <section class="code">
        <p>name = "Corey"<br>
        print name&lsqb;0&rsqb; &num; Result: C<br>
        print name&lsqb;2&rsqb; &num; Result: r<br>
        print name&lsqb;-1&rsqb; &num; Result: y</p>
      </section>

      <p>Trying to index a character that isn't in the string produces an 
        error:</p>

      <section class="code">IndexError: string out of range</section>

      <p>It is possible to index more than one character. You can specify a
        starting and stopping character then use the characters between them.
        The index will stop immediately before the stopping character. An empty
        specification will run to the beginning or end of the string.</p>

      <section class="code">
        word = 'assume'<br>
        print word[3] &num; Result: u<br>
        print word[3:4] &num; Result: u<br>
        print word[3:3] &num; This stops where it starts. Result:  <br>
        print word[4:6] &num; From 4 to 6. Result: me<br>
        print word[4:] &num; From 4 to end. Result: me<br>
        print word[:2] &num; From beginning to 2. Result: as<br>
        print word[:] &num; From beginning to end. Result: assume<br>
      </section>

      <p>It is also possible to search for a string within a string.</p>

      <span class="code">&lt;string1&gt;.find&lpar;&lt;string2&gt;&rpar;</span>

      <p>This will not print the string itself but the numerical position of
        the first character of the second string within the larger string. The
        result be -1 if the string can't be found. An empty string, meaning no
        space between the quotation marks, will always be found. Python thinks
        that every string begins with the empty string.<p>

      <section class="code">
        print "test".find&lpar;"te"&rpar; &num; Result: 0<br>
        print "test".find&lpar;"st"&rpar; &num; Result: 2<br>
        print "text".find&lpar;"text"&rpar; # Result: 0<br>
        print "text".find&lpar;"Text"&rpar; # Python is case sensitive. 
          Result: -1<br>
        print "text".find&lpar;""&rpar; # This is an empty string. Result: 0
          <br>
        print "text".find&lpar;" "&rpar; # This is a space. Result: -1<br>
      </section>
      
      <p>You can find the second, third, and so on occurrence of a string by
        specifying a starting position after the first character of the string.
      </p>

      <section class="code">
        &lt;string1&gt;.find&lpar;&lt;string2&gt;, &lt;number&gt;&rpar;<br>
        print "test".find&lpar;"t"&rpar; &num; Result: 0<br>
        print "test".find&lpar;"t", 1&rpar; &num; Result: 3<br>
      </section>

      <p>There is also a built-in method for replacing part of a string with
        a new string.</p>
      <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;.replace&lpar;&lt;old&gt;,
        &lt;new&gt;&lsqb;, &lt;max&gt;&rsqb;&rpar;</span>

      <p> The <span class="code">&lsqb;, &lt;max&gt;&rsqb;;</span> part is
        optional and specifies the maximum number of times to make the
        replacement. Don't include the square brackets as that is just
        notation for optional.</p>

      <section class="code">
        sentence = "A NOUN went on a walk. They can VERB really well."<br>
        sentence = sentence.replace("NOUN", "duck")<br>
        sentence = sentence.replace("VERB", "waddle")<br>
        print sentence &num; Result: A duck went on a walk. They can waddle
          really well.<br>
